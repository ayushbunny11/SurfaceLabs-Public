# ReqioIQ

ReqioIQ is an AI-powered assistant that helps developers add **specific features** to existing codebases — without rebuilding the whole application.  

Instead of asking an AI to “generate an entire app”, ReqioIQ focuses on **incremental development**: it understands your project, then guides you with code changes that fit naturally into it.

---

## 🚀 What problem does it solve?

Most AI tools struggle with real-world codebases:

- They don’t fully understand project structure
- They overwrite files instead of modifying them safely
- They generate code that doesn’t match the project style
- Developers waste time integrating and fixing AI output

ReqioIQ is built to work **inside existing projects**, not replace them.

---

## ✨ What ReqioIQ does

- 🔎 Analyzes your repository (GitHub or local project)
- 🧠 Understands architecture, dependencies, and patterns
- 📝 Accepts natural-language feature requests (e.g.,  
  *“Add JWT authentication and protect the dashboard API”*)
- 🛠 Generates **targeted diffs and code suggestions**
- 📌 Explains where changes go — and why
- ⚠ Avoids overwriting working code

ReqioIQ acts like a smart collaborator sitting in your IDE.

---

## 🎯 Why it’s useful

ReqioIQ helps you:

- build faster without rewriting everything
- safely introduce new features
- reduce bugs caused by copy-paste AI code
- learn best practices from structured explanations
- integrate AI output confidently

It’s especially powerful for:

- growing startups
- hackathon teams
- junior developers
- solo builders maintaining large projects
- product teams shipping frequent updates

---

## 🌟 The vision

ReqioIQ bridges the gap between:

> **“AI generated some code”**  
> and  
> **“this integrates cleanly into my real project.”**

By focusing on *feature-level intelligence*, it supports modern, iterative development instead of one-shot code generation.

---

## 📌 Status

This is an active, evolving project — expect improvements, iterations, and new capabilities focused on:

- smarter repo understanding  
- versioned API support  
- safer AI-driven code generation  
- developer-first tooling
